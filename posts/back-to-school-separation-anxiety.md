The backpacks are packed, the school bus schedules are on the fridge, and the lazy, unscheduled days of summer are coming to an end. While you and your family are getting back into a routine, someone might be feeling left behind: **your dog**.

After a summer of constant companionship, the sudden shift to a quiet, empty house can be jarring for our pets. This change often leads to what's known as **separation anxiety**, which can manifest as barking, destructive chewing, or general distress.

The good news is that with a little patience and a few proactive steps, you can help your best friend adjust to the new normal. Here are five ways to ease their back-to-school blues.

## 🚪 1. Practice Your Departures

Dogs are creatures of habit and masters at picking up cues. They know that you grabbing your keys and work bag means you're leaving. To reduce the anxiety associated with these cues, you need to **desensitize them**.

### How to Get Started:
- **Step 1:** Start by going through your leaving routine, but don't actually leave. Pick up your keys and walk to the door, then sit back down on the couch. Do this several times until your dog no longer reacts anxiously.
- **Step 2:** Practice short departures. Leave for just 30 seconds, then a minute, then five minutes, gradually increasing the time. This teaches them that you always come back.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Make these practice sessions fun! Give your dog a treat when you return to create positive associations with your departures.

## 🏠 2. Create a "Safe Haven"

Designate a comfortable, safe space in your home that is exclusively for your dog. This could be a crate (if they are crate-trained), a dog bed in a quiet corner, or even a small room. The goal is to make this spot a **sanctuary of calm and positivity**.

### Setting Up Your Dog's Sanctuary:
- **Location:** Choose a quiet area away from high-traffic zones
- **Comfort:** Furnish with their favorite blanket, bed, and toys
- **Special Treats:** Only give high-value treats (like peanut butter-filled KONG toys) in this spot
- **Positive Association:** This helps them build a strong connection with the space

> 🎯 **Goal:** Your dog should see this space as their personal retreat where they feel safe and relaxed.

## 🏃‍♀️ 3. A Tired Dog is a Happy Dog

A bored mind is an anxious mind. Before you leave for the day, make sure your dog has had plenty of **physical and mental exercise**. A sleepy, satisfied dog is far less likely to feel anxious when left alone.

### Exercise Ideas:

#### Physical Exercise:
- **Morning Walks:** Start the day with a brisk 20-30 minute walk
- **Active Play:** Games of fetch, tug-of-war, or running in the park
- **Swimming:** If your dog enjoys water, swimming is excellent low-impact exercise

#### Mental Stimulation:
- **Puzzle Toys:** Make them work for their breakfast with treat-dispensing toys
- **Training Sessions:** Practice commands or teach new tricks
- **Sniffing Games:** Hide treats around the house for them to find

> ⚡ **Remember:** Mental exercise can be just as tiring as physical exercise for dogs!

## 🤫 4. Keep Hellos and Goodbyes Low-Key

This is often the hardest tip for owners to follow, but it's one of the most important. When you make a huge, emotional fuss over leaving or returning, it reinforces the idea that your absence is a **major event to be anxious about**.

### The Calm Approach:

#### When You Leave:
- Give your dog a calm pat and a simple "I'll be back"
- Leave without any dramatic, drawn-out goodbyes
- Keep your energy relaxed and matter-of-fact

#### When You Return:
- **Ignore your dog** for the first few minutes, even if they're jumping excitedly
- Put your bags down, get a glass of water, settle in
- Once they've calmed down, greet them with a relaxed and gentle hello

> 🧘 **Why This Works:** This teaches them that your comings and goings are normal, not a cause for panic or over-excitement.

## ⏰ 5. Schedule a Mid-Day Break

For many dogs, the biggest challenge is the **long, uninterrupted stretch of time** they're left alone. Breaking up the day with a short visit can make a world of difference. A walk and a potty break not only helps them physically but also eases the loneliness and boredom that fuel anxiety.

### Options for Mid-Day Care:
- **Come home yourself** (if your schedule allows)
- **Ask a trusted neighbor** to check in
- **Hire a professional dog walker**
- **Use a pet care service** like Animo by PawPal
