The backpacks are packed, the school bus schedules are on the fridge, and the lazy, unscheduled days of summer are coming to an end. While you and your family are getting back into a routine, someone might be feeling left behind: your dog.

After a summer of constant companionship, the sudden shift to a quiet, empty house can be jarring for our pets. This change often leads to what's known as separation anxiety, which can manifest as barking, destructive chewing, or general distress.

The good news is that with a little patience and a few proactive steps, you can help your best friend adjust to the new normal. Here are five ways to ease their back-to-school blues.

### 1. Practice Your Departures
Dogs are creatures of habit and masters at picking up cues. They know that you grabbing your keys and work bag means you're leaving. To reduce the anxiety associated with these cues, you need to desensitize them.

- **How to do it:** Start by going through your leaving routine, but don't actually leave. Pick up your keys and walk to the door, then sit back down on the couch. Do this several times until your dog no longer reacts anxiously.
- **Next step:** Practice short departures. Leave for just 30 seconds, then a minute, then five minutes, gradually increasing the time. This teaches them that you always come back.

### 2. Create a "Safe Haven"
Designate a comfortable, safe space in your home that is exclusively for your dog. This could be a crate (if they are crate-trained), a dog bed in a quiet corner, or even a small room. The goal is to make this spot a sanctuary of calm and positivity.

- **How to do it:** Furnish the space with their favorite blanket and toys. Only give them their most special, high-value treats (like a peanut butter-filled KONG) in this spot. This helps them build a strong positive association with the space and gives them a comforting place to retreat to when they're alone.

### 3. A Tired Dog is a Happy Dog
A bored mind is an anxious mind. Before you leave for the day, make sure your dog has had plenty of physical and mental exercise. A sleepy, satisfied dog is far less likely to feel anxious when left alone.

- **Physical Exercise:** Start the day with a brisk walk, a run in the park, or an energetic game of fetch.
- **Mental Stimulation:** Use puzzle toys or treat-dispensing balls to make them work for their breakfast. This engages their brain and builds confidence. The mental effort required is often just as tiring as physical exercise.

### 4. Keep Hellos and Goodbyes Low-Key
This is often the hardest tip for owners to follow, but it's one of the most important. When you make a huge, emotional fuss over leaving or returning, it reinforces the idea that your absence is a major event to be anxious about.

- **When you leave:** Give your dog a calm pat and a simple "I'll be back," then leave without any dramatic, drawn-out goodbyes.
- **When you return:** Ignore your dog for the first few minutes, even if they're jumping excitedly. Put your bags down, get a glass of water, and once they've calmed down, greet them with a relaxed and gentle hello. This teaches them that your comings and goings are normal, not a cause for panic or over-excitement.

### 5. Schedule a Mid-Day Break
For many dogs, the biggest challenge is the long, uninterrupted stretch of time they're left alone. Breaking up the day with a short visit can make a world of difference. A walk and a potty break not only helps them physically but also eases the loneliness and boredom that fuel anxiety.

If your new schedule doesn't allow you to come home for lunch, consider a trusted neighbor or a local dog walker.
